# mikro-phonebook

Requires an installation of node and above for the js files

Also install python to run the py script

## Note that it is easier to save the phone number as a string in the contact object to avoid int overflow
## Then we parse it into a number or long int where necessary. 

#### node main to run main.js
#### node oop-main to run oop-main.js
#### python3 main.py to run main.py

Results are as seen in the function invocations
